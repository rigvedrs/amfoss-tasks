I did this task till figuring out how to use the tabBar , understanding how the code works and its basic structure. But understanding this language took a really long time, especially the part of creating widgets and classes and calling them in the main class, but I could not figure out where to use the dots indicator, so I thought of stopping till that part and submitting this much of the code till where I could reach.
