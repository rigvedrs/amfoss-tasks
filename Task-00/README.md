I Dual booted github so that I could use Windows as well. In the beginning I had my old laptop in which I thought of installing Ubuntu, but since it was really slow, I decided 
to just download it and wait for my new laptop to come! After my laptop came, I just transferred it through pendrive in my laptop, flashed it back in the pendrive and then just followed the installation steps. The process was pretty simple and most of the stuff was handled by the software itself.
